Graduation example: case 3
==========================

In this tutorial, the mesh is already graduated and a mesh adaptation algorithm is performed on it. A tag array indicates which cells must be refined, or kept to build the new mesh. We want to modify the tag array to be sure that the new mesh created from the tag will be graduated. The complete example can be downloaded here: :download:`graduation case 3 <../../../demos/tutorial/graduation_case_3.cpp>`

We start from a mesh refined at a given level and use criteria to tag a cell to be refined if the criteria is true.

The chosen criteria is if one of the following points is inside a cell, then the cell must be refined.

.. math::

    \begin{cases}
    x = sin(at + \delta) \\
    y = sin(bt)
    \end{cases}
    \; \text{for} \; tÂ \in [0, 2 \pi].

We will take :math:`a = 3`, :math:`b = 2` and :math:`\delta = \frac{\pi}{2}`.

Let's start by creating a mesh at level `start_level` for a 2D domain :math:`[-2, 2] \times [-2, 2]`.

.. code-block:: c++

    samurai::Box<int, dim> box({-2<<start_level, -2<<start_level}, {2<<start_level, 2<<start_level});
    samurai::CellArray<dim> ca;

    ca[start_level] = {start_level, box};

We first create a box of integers that contains the indices of the domain and then we create the `start_level` of the `CellArray` from this box.

Now, we want to apply our criteria on this mesh to tag cells to refine if the criteria is true. We will apply the `for_each_cell` function for that.

We create a field named `tag` attached to the mesh. This field is an array of booleans. If it is set to true, the cell must be refined, and must be kept otherwise.

.. code-block:: c++

    auto tag = samurai::make_field<bool, 1>("tag", ca);
    tag.fill(false);

We initialize all the entries of the field `tag` to `false` meaning that all the cells are kept.

We apply the criteria on each cell.

.. code-block:: c++

    samurai::for_each_cell(ca, [&](auto cell)
    {
        auto corner = cell.corner();
        double dx = cell.length;

        std::size_t npoints = 1<<(max_level+4);
        double a = 3, b = 2, delta = M_PI*.5;
        double dt = 2.*M_PI/npoints;
        double t = 0;

        for(std::size_t it = 0; it < npoints; ++it)
        {
            double xc = std::sin(a*t + delta);
            double yc = std::sin(b*t);

            if ((corner[0] < xc) && (corner[0] + dx > xc) &&
                (corner[1] < yc) && (corner[1] + dx > yc))
            {
                tag[cell] = true;
                break;
            }
            t += dt;
        }
    });

The :cpp:func:`samurai::for_each_cell` function takes two parameters: the first one is the `CellArray` defining the cells where we want to apply an algorithm, the second one is a lambda function with a `cell` parameter. This `cell` parameter is of type :cpp:class:`samurai::Cell`. We use the method :cpp:func:`corner` to have the bottom left point of the cell.

We have tagged the cells and we can now recreate a new mesh from the `tag` field by creating four new cells if it is set to true. We use `CellList` to add new points and new intervals efficiently.

.. code-block: c++

    samurai::CellList<dim> cl;
    samurai::for_each_interval(ca, [&](std::size_t level, const auto& interval, const auto& index)
    {
        auto j = index[0];
        for (int i = interval.start; i < interval.end; ++i)
        {
            if (tag[i + interval.index] && level < max_level)
            {
                cl[level + 1][{2*j}].add_interval({2*i, 2*i+2});
                cl[level + 1][{2*j + 1}].add_interval({2*i, 2*i+2});
            }
            else
            {
                cl[level][index].add_point(i);
            }
        }
    });

    samurai::CellArray<dim> new_ca = {cl, true};

At this point, we haven't paid attention to the graduation of the mesh even if the initial mesh was graduated since it was composed of only one level.

The figure below gives the result with a start level set to 1 and a maximum level set to 6. As we can observe, this mesh is not graduated.

So, we have to add a step between the criteria and the creation of the new mesh from a `CellList` to ensure the graduation.

The idea is the following: we take the cells of a level `l` and we translate them in each direction with a stencil of 1. If an intersection exists with a cell at the level :math:`l - 1` and if the cell at level `l` is tagged as refined then we have to tag the cell at level `l-1` to be refined too. We have to start from the largest level to propagate the tag correctly.

.. code-block:: c++

    xt::xtensor_fixed<int, xt::xshape<4, dim>> stencil{{1, 1}, {-1, -1}, {-1, 1}, {1, -1}};

    for (std::size_t level = ca.max_level(); level > 1; --level)
    {
        for(std::size_t i = 0; i < stencil.shape()[0]; ++i)
        {
            auto s = xt::view(stencil, i);
            auto subset = samurai::intersection(samurai::translate(ca[level], s), ca[level - 1]);

            subset([&](const auto& interval, const auto& index)
            {
                auto j_f = index[0];
                auto i_f = interval.even_elements();

                if (i_f.is_valid())
                {
                    auto mask = tag(level, i_f  - s[0], j_f - s[1]);
                    auto i_c = i_f >> 1;
                    auto j_c = j_f >> 1;
                    xt::masked_view(tag(level - 1, i_c, j_c), mask) = true;
                }

                i_f = interval.odd_elements();
                if (i_f.is_valid())
                {
                    auto mask = tag(level, i_f  - s[0], j_f - s[1]);
                    auto i_c = i_f >> 1;
                    auto j_c = j_f >> 1;
                    xt::masked_view(tag(level - 1, i_c, j_c), mask) = true;
                }
            });
        }
    }

The figure below gives the result of the graduation at each step of the refinement process.
